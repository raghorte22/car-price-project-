Perform data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for model training.
##Feature Engineering:
Extract meaningful features from the dataset.
##Model Selection:
##Training the Model:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model using the training data.
##Model Evaluation:
##Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance.
##Validation and Cross-Validation:
##Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for use in a real-world setting.
Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility.
